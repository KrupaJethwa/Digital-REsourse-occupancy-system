# Digital Resource Occupancy System

## Overview

The **Digital Resource Occupancy System** is an automated solution designed to streamline the management and usage of lab resources in educational institutions. The system facilitates the efficient registration and monitoring of lab resources, including PCs and workstations, while also providing tools for faculty and students to manage lab schedules, attendance, and event registrations. The goal is to improve operational efficiency, reduce manual workload, and enhance the user experience for both faculty and students.

This system enables easy tracking of lab resource utilization, enhances the management of student registrations for lab sessions, and provides real-time data for resource allocation.

## Aim and Objective of the Proposed System

### Aim:
The aim of this project is to automate the lab resource registration and monitoring process, ensuring the system operates in an effective and efficient manner. The system aims to enhance the management of lab resources and ensure smooth operations for both students and faculty.

### Objectives:
The main objectives of the system are as follows:

- **For Faculty**: To reduce the time and effort required to manage student registrations, attendance, and lab schedules. Faculty also handle administrative tasks such as monitoring resource utilization, generating reports, and ensuring the proper allocation of resources.
- **For Students**: To provide a platform where students can easily register for lab resources, view schedules, and track their attendance. This reduces the need for manual updates and paperwork, making the process smoother and more convenient.
